Power Pages is a powerful platform for creating low-code websites. One of its standout features is **Liquid templates**, a flexible templating language that enables dynamic content generation. In this post, weâ€™ll explore how to use Liquid in Power Pages for various scenarios, including content management, data fetching, and conditional logic.

## What Are Liquid Templates?

Liquid is a simple templating language used to enhance dynamic content in Power Pages. It allows you to inject data from your Dataverse, apply logic, and create reusable components for your pages.

## Key Uses of Liquid Templates

### 1. Displaying Content

You can use Liquid to render static or dynamic content seamlessly:

```liquid
<h1>Welcome, {{ user.fullname }}!</h1>
<p>Today's date is {{ "now" | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}</p>
```

This pulls the logged-in user's full name and displays the current date.

### 2. Fetching Data

Liquid makes it easy to query data from Dataverse:

```liquid
{% fetchxml contacts %}
  <fetch top="5">
    <entity name="contact">
      <attribute name="fullname" />
      <order attribute="createdon" descending="true" />
    </entity>
  </fetch>
{% endfetchxml %}

<ul>
  {% for contact in contacts.entities %}
    <li>{{ contact.fullname }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

This example retrieves the 5 most recently created contacts and displays their names in a list using a FetchXML query.

### 3. Using Conditional Logic

Add conditional logic to make your pages dynamic:

```liquid
{% if user %}
  <p>Welcome back, {{ user.fullname }}!</p>
{% else %}
  <p>Hello, guest! Please <a href="/sign-in">sign in</a>.</p>
{% endif %}
```

This checks if a user is logged in and displays appropriate messages.

## Why Use Liquid Templates in Power Pages?

- **Dynamic Content:** Tailor your pages to individual users or scenarios.
- **Seamless Data Integration:** Fetch and display Dataverse data with ease.
- **Flexible Logic:** Handle conditions and loops for rich user experiences.
