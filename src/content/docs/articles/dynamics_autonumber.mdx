## Introduction

Autonumbering in Dynamics 365 is a powerful feature that helps ensure unique record identifiers. However, when migrating data between environments (e.g., Development, Test, UAT, and Production), autonumber collisions can occur if the same numbering format is used across environments. To mitigate these risks, each environment should use a distinct autonumber format.

## Understanding Autonumbering in Dynamics 365

Autonumbering in Dynamics 365 is typically used for entities like Cases, Orders, Invoices, and Custom Entities. By default, autonumber attributes use a specific pattern, but this can be customized to suit business needs.

A typical autonumber format consists of:

- **Prefix**: A static identifier (e.g., `ORD-` for orders)
- **Number Sequence**: A sequential or random numeric value
- **Suffix**: Additional identifiers (optional)

Example format: `ORD-{SEQNUM:5}` generates `ORD-00001`, `ORD-00002`, etc.

## The Problem with Identical Autonumber Formats

When records are migrated between environments, identical autonumber sequences can cause conflicts, such as:

- Duplicate records if autonumbers overlap
- Difficulty tracing the origin of a record
- Data integrity issues when merging databases

## Best Practices for Environment-Specific Autonumber Formats

To prevent numbering conflicts, each environment should have a unique autonumbering format. Here are some best practices:

### 1. **Use Environment-Specific Prefixes**

Incorporate a prefix that identifies the environment:

- **Development**: `DEV-ORD-{SEQNUM:5}`
- **Test**: `TST-ORD-{SEQNUM:5}`
- **UAT**: `UAT-ORD-{SEQNUM:5}`
- **Production**: `ORD-{SEQNUM:5}`

This ensures that records originating from different environments are easily distinguishable.

### 2. **Leverage Date or Year Identifiers**

Adding a year or timestamp helps prevent duplication over long periods. Example:

- `ORD-{YYYY}-{SEQNUM:5}` â†’ `ORD-2025-00001`

### 3. **Use Separate Number Ranges**

If prefixes are not an option, define separate number ranges, which can be done by setting the Autonumber seed to start at different values:

- Development: Starts at 10000
- Test: Starts at 20000
- UAT: Starts at 30000
- Production: Starts at 50000

Example:

- `ORD-{SEQNUM:5}` in Development starts at `ORD-10001`
- `ORD-{SEQNUM:5}` in Production starts at `ORD-50001`

### 4. **Automate Format Changes Per Environment**

Use Power Automate, workflows, or custom plugins to dynamically adjust the autonumber format when records move between environments.

Example plugin logic:

- On record creation, check the environment variable and apply the corresponding format.

### 5. **Document and Standardize Your Approach**

Maintain documentation for autonumber configurations across environments to ensure consistency and avoid accidental conflicts.

## Conclusion

Proper autonumber management in Dynamics 365 ensures smooth record migration and prevents conflicts between environments. By implementing environment-specific prefixes, leveraging timestamps, and using distinct number ranges, organizations can maintain data integrity and traceability across environments.
