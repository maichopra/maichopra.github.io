## Prerequisites

1. Install the [Power Platform CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/cli/install).
2. Ensure you have access to an environment in Microsoft Dataverse with the necessary permissions to export solutions.
3. Authenticate to your environment using `pac auth create`.

## Steps to Export a Solution

### Exporting an Unmanaged Solution

1. **Authenticate to your Dataverse environment:**

   ```bash
   pac auth create --environment https://your-org.crm.dynamics.com
   ```

2. **Export the unmanaged solution:**

   ```bash
   pac solution export --name "<SolutionName>" --path "./solutions" --managed false
   ```

   - Replace `<SolutionName>` with the name of your solution.
     - Remember to use the **name** of the solution and not the display name.
   - The `--managed false` flag ensures that the solution is exported as unmanaged.

3. **Verify the solution file:**
   After export, you should see a ZIP file named `<SolutionName>.zip` in the specified path.

### Exporting a Managed Solution

1. **Authenticate to your Dataverse environment:**
   If you have already authenticated, skip this step.

2. **Export the managed solution:**

   ```bash
   pac solution export --name "<SolutionName>" --path "./solutions" --managed true
   ```

   - Replace `<SolutionName>` with the name of your solution.
   - The `--managed true` flag ensures that the solution is exported as managed.

3. **Verify the solution file:**
   After export, you should see a ZIP file named `<SolutionName>_managed.zip` in the specified path.

## Unpacking the Solution

To enable version control or inspect the contents of the solution, you can unpack it using the `pac solution unpack` command.

1. **Create a folder for unpacking:**

   ```bash
   mkdir ./unpacked-solution
   ```

2. **Unpack the solution:**

   ```bash
   pac solution unpack --zipfile "./solutions/<SolutionName>.zip" --folder "./unpacked-solution"
   ```

   - Replace `<SolutionName>` with the name of your solution.

3. **Review the unpacked files:**
   The unpacked files will be organized in the folder you specified, typically including:
   - `Customizations.xml`
   - Component folders (e.g., `Entities`, `WebResources`)

## Additional Commands

- **Authenticate to a new environment:**

  ```bash
  pac auth create --environment https://new-org.crm.dynamics.com
  ```

- **List available solutions in the environment:**

  ```bash
  pac solution list
  ```

- **Pack the unpacked solution back into a ZIP file:**
  ```bash
  pac solution pack --folder "./unpacked-solution" --zipfile "./solutions/<SolutionName>.zip"
  ```

## Best Practices

- Always export and store both managed and unmanaged versions of your solutions.
- Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage unpacked solutions.
- Ensure solution files are named with version numbers or timestamps to track changes.

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues:** Ensure the correct URL and permissions are used. Run `pac auth list` to check active sessions.
- **Export Errors:** Verify that the solution name matches exactly and that you have appropriate permissions.
- **Unpack Errors:** Ensure the ZIP file path is correct and the destination folder exists.
